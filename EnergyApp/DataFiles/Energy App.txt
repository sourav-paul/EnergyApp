An XML file containing generator data (see accompanying file 
GenerationReport.xml) is produced and provided as input into 
an input folder on a regular basis.
The solution is required to automatically pick up the received
XML file as soon as it is placed in the input folder (location 
of input folder is set in the Application app.config file), 
perform parsing and data processing as appropriate to achieve the following:

1. It is required to calculate and output the Total Generation 
Value for each generator.
        
2. It is required to calculate and output the generator with the
highest Daily Emissions for each day along with the emission value.
        
3. It is required to calculate and output Actual Heat Rate for 
each coal generator.         

The output should be a single XML file in the format as specified
by an example accompanying file GenerationOutput.xml into an output 
folder (location of output folder is set in the Application app.config file).
Note that the provided XML examples are for the illustration only.
They demonstrate the expected XML structure but do not contain the 
matching data. For sake of clarity GenerationOutput.xml does not 
provide a solution for GenerationReport.xml included in the package.
Calculation Definitions and Reference Data

Daily Generation Value = Energy x Price x ValueFactor

Daily Emissions = Energy x EmissionRating x EmissionFactor

Actual Heat Rate = TotalHeatInput / ActualNetGeneration

Emissions only apply to fossil fuel generator types e.g. coal and gas. 
There could be a varying number of generators of a given type in any one 
GenerationReport.xml file that is produced.

ValueFactor and EmissionsFactor is static data sourced from the accompanying 
XML file ReferenceData.xml. Note: it is not possible to change static data 
while the console application is running.

Generator Types map to factors as follows:

|---------------------------------------------------|
|Generator Type	| ValueFactor	| EmissionFactor    |
|---------------------------------------------------|
|Offshore Wind	| Low			| N/A               |
|---------------------------------------------------|
|Onshore Wind	| High			| N/A               |
|---------------------------------------------------|
|Gas			| Medium		| Medium            |
|---------------------------------------------------|
|Coal           | Medium        | High              |
|---------------------------------------------------|
